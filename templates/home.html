        <h2>Welcome to GLUCO-VISION</h2>
        <p>Your reliable assistant for predicting diabetes and taking care of your health!</p>
        <p>
            <strong>GlucoVision</strong> refers to the ability to foresee or monitor glucose levels, with an emphasis on predicting or managing blood sugar levels for individuals at risk of or living with diabetes.<br>
            <br>
           <strong> "Gluco"</strong> relates to glucose, the sugar found in blood, which is a critical factor in diabetes management.<br>
            <strong>"Vision"</strong> symbolizes insight or predictive capability, suggesting that the system helps users gain foresight into their blood sugar levels and potential risks related to diabetes.<br>
            <br>
<strong>GlucoVision</strong> is a system or tool designed to help users stay informed and proactive about their health by predicting the likelihood of diabetes, enabling early intervention and better management strategies.
<br>

<h1>Scope : </h1>
<p>
    In India, an estimated 77 million adults over the age of 18 are living with type 2 diabetes, 
    while nearly 25 million are considered prediabetic, putting them at an increased risk of developing diabetes
     in the near future. 
    Alarmingly, more than half of those affected are unaware of their diabetic status, 
    which can lead to severe health complications if not detected and treated early.
<br>
    Adults with diabetes face a two- to three-fold higher risk of heart attacks and strokes. 
    Complications such as reduced blood flow and neuropathy (nerve damage) in the feet can increase 
    the risk of foot ulcers, infections, and in extreme cases, may even result in the need for limb amputation. 
    Diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness, arises from long-term damage to the small blood vessels in the retina. 
    Moreover, diabetes is one of the primary contributors to kidney failure.
    <br>
    Our project, <strong>GlucoVision</strong>, aims to empower individuals by offering early insights into their
     potential risk of developing diabetes through advanced machine learning models. 
     By raising awareness and helping users track key health indicators, 
     GlucoVision seeks to reduce the number of undiagnosed cases and promote proactive management of diabetes and its associated complications. With features like personalized health recommendations, preventive tips, and real-time risk assessments, 
    our platform helps users take control of their health,
     reducing the burden of diabetes-related complications in the long term.</p>
