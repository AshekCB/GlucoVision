- **BMI Calculator:** A built-in tool to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI), a key factor in diabetes risk assessment.
- **Age Calculator:** Tool to determine age, which plays a role in diabetes risk prediction.
- **Doctor Appointment Booking:** Schedule appointments with healthcare providers to manage your health proactively.
- **Dia Guard:** Personalized health recommendations and tips for diabetes prevention and management.



## Welcome to GlucoVision!

GlucoVision helps you foresee or monitor glucose levels, focusing on predicting or managing blood sugar levels for individuals at risk of or living with diabetes.

### GlucoVision Explained:

- **Gluco**: Relates to glucose, the sugar found in the blood, which is critical in diabetes management.
- **Vision**: Symbolizes insight or predictive capability, allowing users to gain foresight into their blood sugar levels and diabetes risks.

**GlucoVision** is designed to help users stay proactive about their health by predicting their risk of diabetes, allowing early intervention and better management strategies.

## Empowering Individuals with Early Insights

**GlucoVision** is an intelligent diabetes prediction system designed to empower individuals by providing early insights into their likelihood of developing diabetes. By analyzing key health parameters, the system predicts potential risks, enabling users to take proactive steps toward better health management.

Our predictive model is based on scientifically backed parameters that are crucial indicators of diabetes risk. These include:

- **Number of Pregnancies**: This parameter helps assess the history of pregnancies, which can impact insulin sensitivity, especially in gestational diabetes.
- **Glucose Level**: Elevated glucose levels are a primary indicator of diabetes. The system uses fasting glucose levels to assess your body's ability to regulate sugar.
- **Blood Pressure**: High blood pressure is a known risk factor for diabetes. Maintaining healthy blood pressure is essential in reducing diabetes complications.
- **Skin Thickness**: This measurement, often taken on the triceps, can indicate insulin resistance, especially when combined with other markers like BMI.
- **Insulin Level**: Abnormal insulin levels can be a sign of prediabetes or diabetes, helping gauge the efficiency of the pancreas in regulating blood sugar.
- **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: BMI is a critical factor in diabetes prediction, as excess body fat, particularly around the abdomen, can lead to insulin resistance. 
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: This parameter considers your family history and the genetic predisposition to diabetes. A higher pedigree score indicates a stronger hereditary influence on diabetes risk.
- **Age**: As age increases, the risk of developing diabetes also rises. The system accounts for age as a significant factor in determining potential risk. 
- **Outcome**: Finally, based on these parameters, the system predicts whether an individual is at risk of developing diabetes. This outcome helps guide preventive measures or further medical consultation.

**GlucoVision** brings together these factors in a user-friendly platform to deliver actionable insights, ensuring that users are informed and equipped to make health-conscious decisions. By keeping you informed of your risks, **GlucoVision** helps you take control of your health, empowering you to live a life free from the complications associated with diabetes.

## Scope of GlucoVision

In India, approximately 77 million adults over the age of 18 are living with type 2 diabetes, while nearly 25 million are prediabetic, putting them at an increased risk of developing diabetes. Alarmingly, more than half of those affected are unaware of their diabetic status, leading to severe health complications if not detected and treated early.

Adults with diabetes are two to three times more likely to experience heart attacks and strokes. Complications like reduced blood flow and neuropathy in the feet increase the risk of ulcers and infections, which may require limb amputation. Diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness, results from long-term damage to the small blood vessels in the retina. Diabetes is also a major contributor to kidney failure.

### Mission

Our project, **GlucoVision**, aims to empower individuals by providing early insights into their potential risk of developing diabetes using advanced machine learning models. By raising awareness and helping users track key health indicators, **GlucoVision** seeks to reduce undiagnosed cases and promote proactive management of diabetes and its associated complications.

With features like personalized health recommendations, preventive tips, and real-time risk assessments, **GlucoVision** helps users take control of their health, reducing the burden of diabetes-related complications in the long term.
